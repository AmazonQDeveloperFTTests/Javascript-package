# Palindrome Check

A Palindrome is a string such that the string reads the same
forwards and backwards. This means that the second half of the
string is the first half reversed.

## Examples

The following are palindromes (thus would return TRUE):

- "pop"
- "deed"
- "kayak"
- "racecar"

The following are NOT palindromes (thus would return FALSE):

- "rad"
- "dodo"
- "polo"
