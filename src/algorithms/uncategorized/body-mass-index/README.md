# Body mass index
**Body mass index** is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m<sup>2</sup>, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters.

| Value     | Category        |
| --------- | --------------- |
| <18,5     | Underweight     |

## Advantages
Having a good BMI can reduce your risk of getting chronic conditions.

## Disadvantages
* BMI is not always accurate. For example, a very strong and very healthy person may be in the Obese category and a very fat and very unhealthy person may be put in the Normal category.
* There is a seperate BMI algorithm for kids and teens ages 2 through 19 years.
