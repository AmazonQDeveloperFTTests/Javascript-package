# N-Queens Problem

The **eight queens puzzle** is the problem of placing eight chess queens 
on an `8×8` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. 
Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, 
column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the 
more general *n queens problem* of placing n non-attacking queens 
on an `n×n` chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural 
numbers `n` with the exception of `n=2` and `n=3`.

For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem.

The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks 
where queens are placed. For example following is the output matrix 
for above 4 queen solution.

```
{ 0,  1,  0,  0}
{ 0,  0,  0,  1}
{ 1,  0,  0,  0}
{ 0,  0,  1,  0}
```

## Naive Algorithm

Generate all possible configurations of queens on board and print a 
configuration that satisfies the given constraints.

```
while there are untried configurations
{
   generate the next configuration
   if queens don't attack in this configuration then
   {
      print this configuration;
   }
}
```

## Backtracking Algorithm

The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, 
starting from the leftmost column. When we place a queen in a 
column, we check for clashes with already placed queens. In 
the current column, if we find a row for which there is no 
clash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution. 
If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack 
and return false.

```
1) Start in the leftmost column
2) If all queens are placed
    return true
3) Try all rows in the current column.  Do following for every tried row.
    a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row then mark this [row, 
        column] as part of the solution and recursively check if placing  
        queen here leads to a solution.
    b) If placing queen in [row, column] leads to a solution then return 
        true.
    c) If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution then umark this [row, 
        column] (Backtrack) and go to step (a) to try other rows.
3) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger 
    backtracking.
```

## FIFO Branch And Bound

In Branch and Bound solution, after building a partial solution, 
we figure out that there is no point going any deeper as we are 
going to hit a dead end. 
Just like backtracking, we will use bounding functions to avoid 
generating subtrees that do not contain an answer node.
Algorithm for searching the state space tree for the 4-queens problem:

```
1) Initially, there is only one live node, node 1. This represents the case when no queen has
been placed on the chessboard.
2) This node becomes the E-node.
3) It is expanded and its children, nodes 2, 18, 34 and 50 are generated.
4) These nodes represent a chessboard with queen 1 in row 1 and columns 1, 2, 3 and 4
respectively.
5) The only live nodes now are nodes 2, 18, 34 and 50. If the nodes were generated in this
order, then the next E-node is node 2.
6) It is expanded and nodes 3, 8 and 13 are generated.
7) Node 3 is immediately killed using the bounding function. Nodes 8 and 13 are added to
the queue of live nodes. Node 18 becomes the next E-node.
8) Nodes 19, 24 and 29 are generated.
9) Nodes 19 and 24 are killed as a result of the bounding functions. Node 29 is added to the
queue of live nodes.
10) The next E-node is node 34.
11) Nodes that get killed as a result of the bounding functions have a B under them. Numbers
outside the node give the order in which the nodes are generated by FIFO branch-andbound.
At the time the answer node, node 31, is reached the only live nodes remaining are
nodes 38 and 54.
