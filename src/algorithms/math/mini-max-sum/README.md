# Mini-Max Sum

Given an array of (n) positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that 
can be calculated by summing exactly (n-1) of the array integers. Then return the
respective minimum and maximum values as a array of numbers


```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = [10, 14]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9] = [16, 24]
```
