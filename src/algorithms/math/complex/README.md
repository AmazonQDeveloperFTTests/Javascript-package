#Complex Number

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers, and `i` is
a solution of the equation `x^2 = −1`. Because no real number satisfies this equation, i is called an imaginary 
number. For the complex number `a + bi`, a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part. Despite 
the historical nomenclature `imaginary`, complex numbers are regarded in the mathematical sciences as just as 
`real` as the real numbers, and are fundamental in many aspects of the scientific description of the natural 
world

A complex number is a number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is an indeterminate 
satisfying `i^2 = −1`. For example, `2 + 3i` is a complex number.

A real number a can be regarded as a complex number `a + 0i` whose imaginary part is 0. A purely imaginary 
number bi is a complex number `0 + bi` whose real part is zero. It is common to write a for `a + 0i` and `bi` 
for `0 + bi`. Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, it is common to write `a − bi` with `b > 0` 
instead of `a + (−b)i`, for example `3 − 4i` instead of `3 + (−4)i`.
