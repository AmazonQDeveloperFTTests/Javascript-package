#Combinatorics

In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a 
collection, such that (unlike permutations) the order of selection 
does not matter. For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an 
orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be 
drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a 
pear and an orange. More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a 
subset of k distinct elements of S. If the set has n elements, the 
number of k-combinations is equal to the binomial coefficient

Combination : It is the different selections of a given number of                    elements taken one by one, or some, or all at a time.                  For example, if we have two elements A and B, then there               is only one way select two items, we select both of them.

Number of combinations when `r` elements are selected out of a total of `n` elements is `n C r = n! / [ (r !) x (n – r)! ]`. For example, 
let `n` = 4 `(A, B, C and D)` and `r`= 2 (All combinations of size 2).
The answer is `4!/((4-2)!*2!)` = 6. The six combinations are `AB`,
`AC`, `AD`, `BC`, `BD`, `CD`.

`n C r = n C (n – r)`

`n P r = n C r * r!`
