#Permutation

In mathematics, the notion of permutation relates to the act of 
arranging all the members of a set into some sequence or order, or if 
the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a 
process called permuting. These differ from combinations, which are 
selections of some members of a set where order is disregarded. For 
example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set 
`{1,2,3}`, namely: `(1,2,3)`, `(1,3,2)`, `(2,1,3)`, `(2,3,1)`, 
`(3,1,2)`, and `(3,2,1)`. These are all the possible orderings of this 
three element set. As another example, an anagram of a word, all of 
whose letters are different, is a permutation of its letters. In this 
example, the letters are already ordered in the original word and the 
anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of 
finite sets is a topic in the field of combinatorics.

Permutation : It is the different arrangements of a given number of
              elements taken one by one, or some, or all at a time.
              For example, if we have two elements A and B, then there
              are two possible arrangements, AB and BA.

Number of permutations when `r` elements are arranged out of a total
of `n` elements is `n P r = n! / (n â€“ r)!`. For example, let `n` = 4 
`(A, B, C and D)` and `r` = 2 (All permutations of size 2). The answer
is `4!/(4-2)! = 12`. The twelve permutations are `AB`, `AC`, `AD`, 
`BA`, `BC`, `BD`, `CA`, `CB`, `CD`, `DA`, `DB` and `DC`.
