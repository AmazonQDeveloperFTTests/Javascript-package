# Parity
In mathematics, **parity** is the property of a number of wether it is even or odd.

## Finding parity of an integer
To find the parity of an integer, divide the integer by 2 and check if the remainder is equal to 0. If the remainder is equal to 0, then the parity of the integer is even, but if the remainder is not equal to 0, then the parity of the integer is odd.

### Examples
* 10 is an even number because the remainder will be equal to 0 when it is divided by 2.
* 25 is an odd number because the remainder will be equal to 1 when it is divided by 2.

## Finding the parity of a decimal
To find the parity of a decimal, check if the last digit is even or odd (the last digit is an integer). If the last digit is even, then the parity of the decimal is even, but if the last digit is odd, then the parity of the decimal is odd.

### Examples
* 2.5 is an odd number because the last digit, which is 5, is an odd number.
* 1.2 is an even number because the last digit, which is 2, is an even number.
