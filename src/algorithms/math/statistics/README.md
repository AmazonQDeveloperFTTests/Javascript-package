# Statistics
It is often useful to calculate various statistics on a data set.  Most of the useful statistics (e.g. sum, mean, variance, skew, kurtosis) are related to the moments of the distribution.  Naive calculations from these statistics generally suffer from overflow, numerical error, and/or catastrophic cancellation.  Dealing with these issues is generally difficult and has led to the creation of many algorithms with a large number of variants.
