<h1>Extended Euclidean Algorithm </h1>

The standard Euclidean algorithm only calculates the gcd of a and b given 2 integers a and b. The extended Euclidean algorithm takes this one step further. For any 2 integers 
a, b, the extended Euclidean algorithm calculates x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b).
