# Extended Euclidean algorithm

In arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm,
and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor of integers a and b, also the coefficients of BÃ©zout's 
identity, which are integers x and y such that `ax + by = gcd(a,b)`.
This is a certifying algorithm, because the gcd is the only number that can simultaneously satisfy this equation and 
divide the inputs. It allows one to compute also, with almost no extra cost, the quotients of a and b by their 
greatest common divisor.
