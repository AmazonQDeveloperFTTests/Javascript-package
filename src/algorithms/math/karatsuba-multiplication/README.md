# Karatsuba Multiplication

Karatsuba is a fast multiplication algorithm discovered by Anatoly Karatsuba in 1960. Given two n-digit numbers, the "grade-school" method of long multiplication has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), whereas the karatsuba algorithm has a time complexity of O(n<sup>1.59</sup>).
