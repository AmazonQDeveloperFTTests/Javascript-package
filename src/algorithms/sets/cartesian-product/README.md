# Cartesian Product

In set theory a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set 
(or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets A and B,
the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b)
where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. 

The Cartesian product `AxB` of two sets `A={x,y,z}` and `B={1,2,3}` would return `{{x,1},{x,2},{x,3},{y,1},{y,2}{y,3},{z,1},{z,2},{z,3}}`

If A and/or B are empty sets then the cartesian product is also an empty set
