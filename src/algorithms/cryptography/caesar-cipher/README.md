# Ceasar Cipher
**Caesar cipher**, also known as the shift cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.


## Encryption Function
e(x) = (x+k) mod(26)
## Decryption Function
e(x) = (x-k) mod(26)

Where x is the text to be encrypted/decrypted and k is the private key or the amount by which the characters need to be shifted
